## Hello!

Welcome to my virtual lab! This is meant to be, first and foremost, a collection of memories for my older self. I hope this space also serves as an easy-to-share place for all things for family/friends.

- If you're here on purpose, you know where to look. 
- If you're a recruiter, thank you for coming by. I'm probably not looking for opportunities right now. If you're curious anyway, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcoruizv/) is the best place to reach me.
- If you're lost, what you'll find here will probably be boring for you. I haven't made updates since 2020 and I'm not sure when I'll get back to it.

Have a great day! 👋 😃
