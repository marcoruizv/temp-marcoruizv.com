# WARNING: WEB HOME UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

## Hello!

First of all, if you want to get in touch or get a slight idea of what I do, you can head over to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcoruizv/).

The purpose of this website is to be:  
1) an in-depth look at who I am and what I do - a resume of my life - for my older self.  
2) a lab, a playground for me to learn and experiment with various web-related technologies.

## What I'm currently working with and/or learning about as I rebuild this "webhome":

**New for me:**  
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)  
- "Modern web tech" - React, webpack, JS, CSS  
- Multiple data integrations - GraphQL, APIs, CMSs  
- Future-proof - JAMstack  
- Scale easily - "static" site, PWA  
- Speed!  

[Amplify Framework](https://aws-amplify.github.io/)  
- "flexible, scalable, and reliable serverless backend"  
- Library, toolchain, ui components  
- Easy integration with technologies I already use (AWS, Git, GitHub)  

**Tried-and-true setup:**  
- For version control: [Git](https://git-scm.com/)  
- Code management: [GitHub](https://github.com/features)  
- Hosting/DNS/Storage: [AWS - S3, Route53, IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/)  
- Writing/editing/coding/etc: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  

The magic happens thanks to a [Bionic Beaver VM](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-ab&q=Ubuntu+18.04) running off a flashdrive for portability.

**Other things I'm learning about (courses I'm taking):**  
- Docker Fundamentals & Docker for DevOps, acloudguru  
- CompTIA Linux and LPIC-1 System Administrator, acloudguru  
- Architecting Microsoft Azure Solutions, acloudguru  
- Data Scientist with Python, DataCamp  
- Advanced AWS CloudFormation, acloudguru  
- Data Science in Python, Coursera - University of Michigan  


NOTE: The "barebones" look of this page is on-purpose. #Markdown :)
