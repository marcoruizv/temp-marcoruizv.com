## Hello!

Welcome to my virtual lab! This is meant to be, first and foremost, a collection of memories for my older self. I hope this space also serves as an easy-to-share place for all things for family/friends. 

If you're here on purpose, you know where to look. 
If you're a recruiter, thank you for coming by. Chances are I'm not looking for a job right now. If you're curious anyway, LinkedIn is the best place to reach me.
If you're lost, what you'll find will probably be boring for you.

Have a great day! 👋 😃
